# qacBase

<!-- badges: start -->

**R** is a wonderful language and platform for data science. Unfortunately, many simple tasks in data preparation, data exploration, and data visualization can be more difficult than necessary.  

The goal of the **qacBase** package is to provide **convenient statistical functions** for the common data science task we perform every day.

### Installation

You can install this package with the following code:

``` r
if(!require(remotes)){
   install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("rkabacoff/qacBase")
```

### Using the package

The easiest way to get started is, appropriately enough, by reading the [**Getting Started**](https://rkabacoff.github.io/qacBase/articles/qacBase.html) guide. Next, take a look at the
[Documentation](https://rkabacoff.github.io/qacBase/reference/index.html). There are also *vignettes* on specific topics.

**Suggestions are always welcome!**
